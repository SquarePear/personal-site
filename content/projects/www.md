This website is built using Nuxt.js, a framework for Vue.js. It is hosted on
Netlify. I use Netlify to automatically build and deploy the website when I
push to the GitHub repository. I chose Nuxt.js because it is easy to use and
I had some previous experience with Vue.js. I am not a designer, but I tried
to make the website look nice using all custom CSS so I could learn more
about how CSS works. I also used TypeScript to make the code easier to read
and maintain.
