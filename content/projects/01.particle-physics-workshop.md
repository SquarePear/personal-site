This is a workshop I created for Hack Club's workshop bounty program. Hack Club is a non-profit organization that helps high school students start coding clubs and learn to code. I decided to make a physics simulation because I have always enjoyed physics in school. It's also a great way to get interesting and exciting animations that are different every time!
