HabiTile is a game where you and your opponent take turns placing tiles on a
board. Each tile has point values based on the tiles around it. The goal is to
get the most points by the end of the game.

I worked on this project with a multidisciplinary team of students from
different majors (Computer Science, Art, and Music). It was a collaboration
between Ball State University and Minnetrista, a local museum. We had one
semester to complete the project with a team of 14 students.
