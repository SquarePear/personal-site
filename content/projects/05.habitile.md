HabiTile is a game where you and your opponent take turns placing tiles on a board. Each tile has point values based on the tiles around it. The goal is to get the most points by the end of the game.

HabiTile was created as part of a semester-long project at Ball State University in the Spring of 2023. The game was developed using the Godot game engine and GDScript. I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of students from different majors (Computer Science, Art, and Music) to complete the project.

The project was a collaboration between Ball State University and Minnetrista, a local museum in Muncie, Indiana.
